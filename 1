WHY Hibernate?
It mediates the applications interaction with a relational database, leaving the developer free to concentrate on the business problem at hand.
J2EE developer does not have to use JDBC API & manage data persistence at RDBMS level.
No need to go to Table/Query/Column level.
One has to bootstrap Hibernate framework , create transient(=not yet persistent) POJOs & then rely entirely on Hibernate frmwork to manage persistence

** problem that hibernate is trying to solve 
 would have five you they're objects in my memory now let's say I want to save these user data how would I do that I would use a database
